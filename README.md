# DataAugmentation
It is a model for augmentation of image dataset. Augmentation of image is carried out by the process of resize, scale, rotate, translation, transpose, blurring, and by adding noise to the image. Dataset(X_train) can be augmented to 10x of its original size while saving y_train data for each image.
